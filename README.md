_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
I did not use WakaTime however I believe that I would have only worked on the assignment for about 12 hours.
With frequent breaks and procrastinating.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
M ability to program has improved quite a bit in a short amount of time. The most satisfing thing was when I got it to
add then error check then sort in priority then save the to csv  for the first time.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
My in ability to actually use this program on my phone. As I have an iPhone. This app can be easily edited to be a
Things to do list or even just use it as a shopping list.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Starting some of it early. As inevitably I did leave things to the last moment.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Start earlier so that I'm using the assignment to consolidate things learnt in pracs.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
Peer help is always my most used resource. Sitting in a computer lab late at night asking each other questions
and helping each other de-bug, although the previous prac files were also a massive help as well

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
Main obstacle was starting. Once i started i got on a roll and got things done. However at the start of every session
it would take me a while to get into it and switch my head on, but once i did I completed tasks quickly and efficiently.
